    <h2>About Manchester City</h2>
    <p class="mb-3 text-justify">Manchester City, one of the premier clubs in England, has a rich history and a promising future. Manchester City Football Club, based in Manchester, England, was founded in 1880 under the original name St. Mark's (West Gorton). The club later changed its name to Ardwick A.F.C. in 1887, before finally becoming Manchester City in 1894. The early years were marked by a combination of successes and challenges. City won their first major trophy, the FA Cup, in 1904, making them the first club from Manchester to claim a significant national honor. This achievement marked the beginning of a growing reputation in English football, even as the club struggled for consistency in the decades that followed.</p>

    <p class="mb-3 text-justify">During the 1930s, Manchester City reached new heights, winning their first league title in 1937. However, in a twist of fate, they were relegated the following season despite being the league’s top scorers—an occurrence that underscored the club’s unpredictable journey. Post-World War II, City experienced a resurgence, winning the FA Cup in 1956 in a memorable final against Birmingham City, famous for goalkeeper Bert Trautmann playing with a broken neck.</p>

    <p class="mb-3 text-justify">The 1960s and 1970s were arguably a golden era for Manchester City. Managed by Joe Mercer and his assistant Malcolm Allison, the team won the league championship in 1968, followed by an FA Cup win in 1969 and a European Cup Winners' Cup triumph in 1970. This period featured legendary players such as Colin Bell, Francis Lee, and Mike Summerbee, who became iconic figures in the club's history.</p>

    <p class="mb-3 text-justify">However, following their successes in the 1970s, Manchester City entered a prolonged period of decline. The club faced relegation multiple times throughout the 1980s and 1990s, even dropping to the third tier of English football in 1998—a low point in their storied history. Despite these struggles, loyal fans continued to support the team, and City managed a dramatic playoff victory in 1999 to secure promotion back to the second tier, signaling the start of their climb back to prominence.</p>

    <p class="mb-3 text-justify">The true transformation of Manchester City began in 2008 when Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan of the Abu Dhabi United Group acquired the club. This ushered in a new era marked by significant financial investment, allowing City to attract world-class talent and build a competitive squad. The club’s fortunes changed dramatically, with key signings such as Yaya Touré, David Silva, Sergio Agüero, and Vincent Kompany forming the backbone of a new golden era.</p>

    <p class="mb-3 text-justify">Under the management of Roberto Mancini, Manchester City won the 2011 FA Cup, ending a 35-year trophy drought. The following season, in 2012, the club secured their first Premier League title in dramatic fashion when Sergio Agüero scored a last-minute goal against Queens Park Rangers, sealing a 3-2 victory that remains one of the most iconic moments in football history. Further success followed under Manuel Pellegrini, including another Premier League title in 2014 and domestic cup victories.</p>

    <p class="mb-3 text-justify">The appointment of Pep Guardiola as manager in 2016 marked a new chapter of tactical sophistication and dominance. Under Guardiola's leadership, Manchester City set numerous records, including achieving 100 points in the 2017-2018 Premier League season, an unprecedented feat in English top-flight history. The club has continued to add to its trophy cabinet with multiple league titles, FA Cups, and League Cups, establishing themselves as one of the most formidable teams in Europe. Guardiola’s philosophy of possession-based, attacking football has become synonymous with Manchester City’s identity, earning them admiration and respect worldwide.</p>

    <p class="mb-3 text-justify">Today, Manchester City is recognized not only for their domestic success but also for their growing influence on the European stage, consistently challenging for the UEFA Champions League. The club's transformation from its humble beginnings to its current status as a global football powerhouse reflects a remarkable journey filled with resilience, ambition, and an unyielding pursuit of excellence.</p>
